This is my first full SQL data analytics project. I am looking at figures provided by companies in different industries that have to lay off staffs over the period covered by the dataset. 
I cleaned the dataset, took out null values and made it look more presentable. 
Then i did some exploratory process to look out for patterns and some interesting explanations in the dataset.
